Hi there! 

I'm Demian Licht.

I'm interested in a variety of projects, basically anything that helps leverage the power of modern technologies to solve everything from mundane "what should I watch on Netflix today" projects to "let's predict the next global demand or insulin".

I have over 9 years of experience leading teams in a variety of tech stacks; but I'm most proficient in MERN techs and python/TensorFlow.

Most of my repos here are private because of ------- reasons. But if you anything peaks your interest let me know; I'm always looking to make myself useful!
